# Midnight Snack: An Obsidian Theme

## For when your notes feel like late-night indulgence—because productivity is always better with a side of guilty pleasure

Welcome to "Midnight Snack," the Obsidian theme that evokes the cozy, forbidden joy of sneaking into the kitchen at 2 a.m. for something delicious. Now your notes can feel as satisfying as that extra slice of pie you weren’t supposed to eat.

### Features:

- **Rich Dark Palette**: Like a midnight feast, your screen is a decadent mix of deep, indulgent hues that make note-taking a delicious experience.
- **Pastel Accents**: Enjoy vibrant touches of pinks and blues that pop like sprinkles on a donut—bright enough to satisfy, but never too overwhelming.
- **Text So Smooth**: With fonts like "Noto Sans" and "Noto Sans Mono," writing feels like spreading creamy peanut butter on warm toast.
- **Tasty Graph Visuals**: Graphs are colorful and tasty, like your favorite candy, but without the sugar crash.

### Installation:

1. Download the theme.
2. Place it in your Obsidian vault’s theme folder.
3. Activate it, and let your productivity have a taste of something sweet.

### Warning:

Side effects may include, but are not limited to:
- Night cravings for more Markdown files.
- Writing so much you forget how to stop—like reaching the bottom of a bag of chips.
- Sneaking in an extra plugin because "just one more" never hurt.
- Creating backlinks like you're on a sugar high—fast and chaotic.

### Usage Tips:

- **Headers** are the toppings of your notes—use them generously, but don’t overdo it, or things will get messy.
- **Tags** are like your secret stash. Keep them organized, or you’ll be lost in the pantry.
- **Links** are the midnight trail that leads you back to your best ideas—follow them at your own risk.
- **Backlinks**? They’re the breadcrumbs—helpful, but easy to lose track of in a late-night haze.

### Support:

Found a bug? Maybe you just need another snack. But if it’s a real issue, drop it off in the bug report (or DM me while you wait for your cookies to cool).

Now get back to writing, night owl. Your notes aren’t going to devour themselves!
